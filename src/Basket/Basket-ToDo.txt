Considerations:

Data Consistency: Ensure that your Basket service is consistent with the Catalog service. 
For example, if an item is removed from the catalog, it should also be handled appropriately in any baskets.

Concurrency Handling: Consider how you will handle concurrent modifications to the basket 
by the same user (e.g., using optimistic concurrency control).
Integration with Catalog Service: Decide how you'll keep item details 
(like name, price, description) up to date in the Basket service. 
You might just store ItemId and fetch details as needed, or synchronize certain item details 
into your Basket service for performance reasons.
